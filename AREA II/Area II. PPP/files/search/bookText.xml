                                 The workload system shall be implemented by the University in line with
                          the  guidelines  on  faculty  workload  policies  and  regulations  by  CHED.  The
                          current  faculty  workload  system  may  be  revised  or  totally  replaced  upon
                          approval of the Board.

                                 The workload system concerns only the instruction function and related
                          activities of the academic teaching staff of Cavite State University. This was
                          finalized  on  14  July  2000  incorporating  the  comments/suggestions  of  the
                          University  Administrative  Council  during  its  03  July  2000  meeting.
                          Amendments and revisions   were again made in December 2002 and May
                          2007 for the following purposes, among  others: define credit units for other
                          activities left to the discretion of the College/Campus Dean, specify the mode
                          of  payment  for  overload  teaching  and  overtime  teaching;  and  suggest
                              source of funds for such payment.

                                 Section  1.  Coverage.  This  set  of  guidelines  covers  all  CvSU  faculty
                          members, whether permanent, temporary, or contractual teachers reporting on
                          full time.

                                            It should be noted, however, that although faculty members
                                     are classified as full-time teachers, they are still required to conduct

                                     The list of those on full-time teaching shall be submitted immediately

                           a. The regular workload of full–time teaching staff in a given   semester shall include
                           only those related to instruction, administrative assignments and other services duly
                           supported by designations issued by the Office of the President of the University
                           (OUP) as recommended by the vice president concerned.


                        b.  Faculty  members  who  opt  to  be  on  full-time  teaching  but  who  conduct  important

                           for those projects based on the guidelines for   research  and  extension  workload.
                           This credit unit shall be added to     instruction  workload  provided  that  these

                        c.  The  final  report  on  faculty  workload,  including  the  summary  thereof,  shall  be
                           submitted to the office of the    Vice President for Academic Affairs for consolidation
                             within the final examination period of every semester.


                        d.  An academic staff who is unable to reach the maximum teaching load per week shall
                           be  required  to  teach  other  courses  in  other  units  of  the  University  and/or  render
                             other  services  deemed  necessary  as  recommended  by  the  Vice  President  for
                           Academic Affairs and approved by the University President  in order to  reach the
                           mandatory 40-hour service per week required of all government personnel.  In no
                           case, however, shall the conduct of other services lead to hiring of additional part-
                           time or full-    time  faculty  member.  Hiring  will  only  be  done  when  all  faculty
                           members are fully loaded at 18 TCH each per week. Exemptions to the required 18
                           TCH, are faculty members with management and supervisory designations specified.
                           The assigning of such other services shall be endorsed by the Vice President of
                           Academic Affairs for approval by the University President.


                        e.  In case faculty members carrying the full load of 18 TCH are given extra teaching
                           assignment scheduled outside the official time, such assignment shall be covered by
                           a job order in order for the faculty member to receive   equitable remuneration.]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[f.  The detailed guidelines for faculty workload system shall be prepared, reviewed and
