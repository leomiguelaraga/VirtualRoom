               PARAMETER A- STUDENT SERVICES PROGRAM (SSP)



               I.   SYSTEM-INPUTS AND PROCESSES

                           ➢ The BOR/BOT approved the Student Services Program

                              The Students Services Program of the University is under the Office of Student
                       Affairs  and  Services  (OSAS)  of  the  University.  Through  the  years,  the  office  had
                       undergone  a  series  of  renaming  it  was  changed  to  Student  Services  Project  in  1986,
                       Student Services in 1989, Student Welfare Services in 1991 and renamed again to Office
                       of Student Affairs in 1998 when DSAC was elevated into university, currently known as
                       Cavite State University. The different services offered by OSA and its guidelines are stated
                       in the student handbook and were based in the CVSU Manual of Operation 2009 which
                       was approved by the Board of Regents (BOR) on September 3, 2009 per Res. No. 85, s.
                       2009.  To  include  relevant  information  about the  university, the  student handbook  was
                       updated and approved by the BOR per Res. No. 84, s. 2006.


                              When the Commission on Higher Education promulgated the "Enhanced Policies
                       and Guidelines on Student Affair and Services" on April 19, 2013 (CMO no. 19, s. 2013),
                       the Office of Student Affairs conducted a workshop on September 22, 2014 to review and
                       revise its existing policies and guidelines with reference to the enhanced policies and
                       guidelines from CHED. As an output, a proposal to rename the OSA to OSAS was made
                       as well as the revision of the composition and organizational structure of the unit.


                              In December 19, 2014, the OSA was officially renamed to Office of Student Affairs
                       and Services (OSAS) by virtue of BOR Resolution no. 77, s. 2014. The office provides
                       different student services to its client such as guidance and counseling, admission and
                       testing, and student development services to like student organization and socio-cultural
                       affairs,  student  publication  and  placement  of  students  and  graduates.  The  mandated
                       Training Program (NSTP) subject was also offered by the office since 2002. And as a sign
                       of commitment to serve its client efficiently, the OSAS conducted another workshop on
                       review and revision of the student Welfare Service of the CVSU Manual of Operation last
                       June  14-16,  2016  with  reference  to  CMO  no.  19,  s.  2013. While  waiting  for  the  BOR
                       approval  of  the  revised  Student  Welfare  Services,  the  Office  continue  and  remain
                       committed to provide student welfare and development activities to the CVSU academic
                       community and the public.]]></page><page Index="4"><![CDATA[ll.    IMPLEMENTATION

                              C.  Since the millennial generation of students nowadays are fond of using social
                                 media networks, the different Student Services Programs of the OSAS as well

                                 Services  where  student  leaders  are  part  of  the  committees  involved  in  the
                                 workshop. This gave the opportunity to the students to be more aware on the
                                 procedures done in the formulation of policies and guidelines in the University.
                                 This may also increase students' sense of engagement or attachment to the

                                 conduct different extracurricular activities that do not fall into the realm of their
                                 normal curriculum of school. It gave them more opportunities to learn values of
                                 teamwork and responsibility. The OSAS as well as the other University official
                                 provided prompt, courteous and efficient services and supports to them since
                                 the activities are still part of what is mandated in the student handbook or in
                                 the University of Operational Manual and gave benefits for the welfare of the

               to the students.



               IMPLEMENTING GUIDELINES ON BASIC GUIDANCE SERVICES

               1. Orientation Services

                             The initial challenge that confronts the Guidance Services Unit is how to inform
               students their rights, privileges and responsibilities as soon as they become a bonafide student
               of the Cavite State University. Hence, orientation service is necessary for the students to cope
               with the new surroundings and how to adhere with the set of academic rules and regulations as
               well as university's norm of conduct.



               2. Appraisal Services

                   Record Form a week after the commencement of classes. The form will become part of the
                   official documents of each student.



                   B. Testing Services
                             This process of collecting information about a student includes the proper use of
                   standardized  tests  and  inventories.  These  are  tests  of  mental  ability,  aptitude  and
                   achievement, which could help predict how well an individual may be expected to profit from
                   future  training.  While  inventories  include  occupational  interests,  study  habits  and  which
                   provide skills, values, attitudes which provide qualitative data needed about the individual.
                             Through the abovementioned services, faculty counselors, instructors and other
                   school officials may advise/request the students to visit the Guidance Office as need arises
                   or deemed necessary.]]></page><page Index="16"><![CDATA[PARAMETER B. STUDENT WELFARE

               Article 1. General Provisions.
                  a. The Code shall apply to all bona fide pupils/students in the elementary, secondary, tertiary
                     and  graduate  levels  of  the  University.  A  pupil/student  is  considered  "bona  fide"  if  being
                     officially enrolled, he attends his classes or performs any school activity inside or out of the
                     school  campus  during  school  days  or  when  required  to  perform  special  school  related
                     activity or authorized to do so on non-school days. He is considered "on vacation" or "on
                     leave" during break of school terms or during holidays or vacation including Saturdays and
                     Sundays, when his school-student relationship is temporary severed.


                  b. Every bona fide student shall obey the laws of the land, the rules and regulations of the
                     University and standards of good society


                  c .A bona fide pupil/student enrolled in the University assumes an obligation to conduct himself
                     in a manner which befits a member of the academic community and which does not hamper
                     the university from the discharge of its educational functions. He thus accepts the rules and
                     regulations which the University prescribed for its members to enforce its effective role as
                     an educational institution.


                  d. The right of the University to impose sanctions against pupil's/ student's improper conduct
                     is derived from and inherent in its obligations to:
                           •  Preserve its standard for academic performance and achievements
                           •  Protect its property and the property of the members of its community.
                           •  Secure the health and safety of persons in the University community
                           •  Preserve peace, insure orderly procedures and maintain student morale
                           •  Protect its name as an educational institution.


                  e.  The  definition  or  specification  of  certain  offenses  or  breaches  of  discipline,  in  separate
                     resolution  of  the  Academic  Council  approved  by  the  Board  of  Regents,  shall  not  be
                     construed to exclude other offenses or breaches, against the rules of discipline promulgated
                     by the President of the University, directors, and teachers in those cases not provided by
                     said bodies.



               Article 2. Class Attendance
                  a. Pupils/ Students are required to attend their classes promptly and regularly. If a university

                     the roll. If his performance is poor he shall be given a grade of "5.0". A high school student
                     who is absent for 10 consecutive days shall be automatically dropped from the roll on the
                     11th  day.  The  said  pupil/student  may  be  readmitted  upon  presentation  of  a  written

                     declared field/special days. Appropriate attire means that it must not be scandalous, e.g.,

                     students to private parties. However, if the case clearly involves the moral character of the
                     student, OSA may take disciplinary action. If it is the case of indebtedness to the University,
                     the existing rules such as withholding of grades shall be applied without prejudice to the
