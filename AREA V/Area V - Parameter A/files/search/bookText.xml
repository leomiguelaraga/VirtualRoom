               Abstract



               Resilience is a broad concept that encompasses individual and social resources to thrive
               from difficult circumstances. The resilience that occurs as a collective effort or country-
               wide phenomenon is referred to as national resilience  (NR), which connotes the ability
               of a nation to deal with crises while keeping its social fabric intact. Like the rest of the
               world, the Philippines has been greatly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and we
               argue that a stable and robust NR is needed to bounce back from the challenges and
               adversities of the crisis. This pioneering study on NR in Filipino adults was conducted
               to  achieve  two  aims  (1)  assess  the  psychometric  properties  of the  Filipino  adapted
               National  Resilience  Scale  (NRS-Filipino)  and  (2)  determine  demographic  and
               psychological  variables  that  influence  NR.  Data  from  401  participants  yielded  an
               exploratory factor analysis with a good model fit for a four-factor solution that is similar
               to the original National  Resilience  Assessment Scale. NRS-Filipino also demonstrated
               acceptable  reliability  and  convergent  validity. Among the  variables  purported to  be
               associated with NR, community resilience, and political attitudes came out as strong
               predictors.

               Abstract

               The  increasing  number  of  adolescents  at  risk  of  non-suicidal  self-injurious  (NSSI)
               behaviors  has  caused  concern  among mental  health  professionals  and  researchers.
               Prior  studies  have  revealed  the  classification,  pervasiveness,  correlates,  forms, and
               functions of NSSI; however, the  behavioral dynamics are still  unexplored. In order to
               bridge this knowledge gap, a sequential-explanatory study was conducted to illustrate,
               describe, and understand the  behavioral dynamics  of Filipino  adolescents  at risk  of
               NSSI.  Fifty-one  participants  completed  a  battery  of  psychological  tests  to  measure
               personality traits and five were interviewed. Results revealed that adolescents at risk for
               NSSI exhibited high levels of neuroticism and openness to experience but low levels of
               extraversion  and  conscientiousness. Borderline  personality  traits  were  also  common
               among  adolescents  with  NSSI  as  evidenced  by  high  levels  of  impulsivity,  affective
               instability, abandonment, and emptiness, but low levels of interpersonal relationships,
               and  self-image. A  model  fit  further  signified  that  only  neuroticism  and  borderline
               personality traits  moderately influence NSSI. Additionally, from the rich  and detailed
               interpretation  of the  interviews  gathered in  this  study, an  interesting  description  of
               behavior  was identified which  includes  (a)  disturbed, (b) diverted  and (c)  devitalized]]></page><page Index="141"><![CDATA[behavior. A descriptive circuitry model emerged illustrating the behavioral dynamics of
               adolescents  engaging with  NSSI  as  a  product of the  intersection  of personality and

               Abstract


               The sanitary landfill located in  Carmona, Cavite, Philippines operated from April 30,
               1993, to March 31, 1998, is now closed and abandoned. Abandoning sanitary landfill
               without proper remediation and rehabilitation efforts pose risks to both humans and
               the  environment.  At  present,  only  grasses  and  shrubs  thrive  in  the  area,  and  no

               rehabilitation efforts were made in this area. The closed landfill is nonfunctional except
               to the nearby inhabitants who use the abundant vegetation for grazing of animals such
               as cows, goats, and chicken. The possibility of heavy metal accumulation in the area is
               expected but is yet to determine. Likewise, its utilization into productive use remains a

               question. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate the existing land use, extent
               of lead  (Pb) contamination  in  the  soil  and  the  grazing food chain  of  the  area  and,
               recommend the  most  practical  and appropriate use of the  place. Understanding the
               dangers it  can  bring to nearby communities  can  be used as  a reference  for putting

               forward plans and policies to protect people's welfare. Although the soil has an average
               of 1.36 ppm that is within the standard set by the US EPA, the level of Pb observed in
               plants,  insects  and  chicken's  liver  are  unsafe  as  compared  to  the Tolerable  Daily
               Intake (TDI) for Pb set by the US FDA. The soil can be converted into non-play areas

               such as a recreational park, but the planting of edible crops and fruit-bearing trees is
               not recommended.]]></page><page Index="142"><![CDATA[I.5 Research outputs are published
