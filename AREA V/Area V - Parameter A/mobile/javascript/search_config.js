The resilience that occurs as a collective effort or country-                wide phenomenon is referred to as national resilience  (NR), which connotes the ability                of a nation to deal with crises while keeping its social fabric intact. Like the rest of the                world, the Philippines has been greatly impacted by the coronavirus pandemic and we                argue that a stable and robust NR is needed to bounce back from the challenges and                adversities of the crisis. This pioneering study on NR in Filipino adults was conducted                to  achieve  two  aims  (1)  assess  the  psychometric  properties  of the  Filipino  adapted                National  Resilience  Scale  (NRS-Filipino)  and  (2)  determine  demographic  and                psychological  variables  that  influence  NR.  Data  from  401  participants  yielded  an                exploratory factor analysis with a good model fit for a four-factor solution that is similar                to the original National  Resilience  Assessment Scale. NRS-Filipino also demonstrated                acceptable  reliability  and  convergent  validity. Among the  variables  purported to  be                associated with NR, community resilience, and political attitudes came out as strong                predictors.                   Louziela P.

Prior  studies  have  revealed  the  classification,  pervasiveness,  correlates,  forms, and                functions of NSSI; however, the  behavioral dynamics are still  unexplored. In order to                bridge this knowledge gap, a sequential-explanatory study was conducted to illustrate,                describe, and understand the  behavioral dynamics  of Filipino  adolescents  at risk  of                NSSI.  Fifty-one  participants  completed  a  battery  of  psychological  tests  to  measure                personality traits and five were interviewed. Results revealed that adolescents at risk for                NSSI exhibited high levels of neuroticism and openness to experience but low levels of                extraversion  and  conscientiousness. Borderline  personality  traits  were  also  common                among  adolescents  with  NSSI  as  evidenced  by  high  levels  of  impulsivity,  affective                instability, abandonment, and emptiness, but low levels of interpersonal relationships,                and  self-image. A  model  fit  further  signified  that  only  neuroticism  and  borderline                personality traits  moderately influence NSSI. Additionally, from the rich  and detailed                interpretation  of the  interviews  gathered in  this  study, an  interesting  description  of                behavior  was identified which  includes  (a)  disturbed, (b) diverted  and (c)  devitalized","behavior. A descriptive circuitry model emerged illustrating the behavioral dynamics of                adolescents  engaging with  NSSI  as  a  product of the  intersection  of personality and                behavior.

Abandoning sanitary landfill                without proper remediation and rehabilitation efforts pose risks to both humans and                the  environment.  At  present,  only  grasses  and  shrubs  thrive  in  the  area,  and  no                 rehabilitation efforts were made in this area. The closed landfill is nonfunctional except                to the nearby inhabitants who use the abundant vegetation for grazing of animals such                as cows, goats, and chicken. The possibility of heavy metal accumulation in the area is                expected but is yet to determine. Likewise, its utilization into productive use remains a                 question. Hence, this study was conducted to investigate the existing land use, extent                of lead  (Pb) contamination  in  the  soil  and  the  grazing food chain  of  the  area  and,                recommend the  most  practical  and appropriate use of the  place. Understanding the                dangers it  can  bring to nearby communities  can  be used as  a reference  for putting                 forward plans and policies to protect people's welfare. Although the soil has an average                of 1.36 ppm that is within the standard set by the US EPA, the level of Pb observed in                plants,  insects  and  chicken's  liver  are  unsafe  as  compared  to  the Tolerable  Daily                Intake (TDI) for Pb set by the US FDA. The soil can be converted into non-play areas                 such as a recreational park, but the planting of edible crops and fruit-bearing trees is                not recommended.","I.5 Research outputs are published                        in national and/or international                                                            journals","","","OUTCOMES                                     O.1.
