             At the beginning of the semester, the


             students were oriented with the guidelines


             they should abide while working in the


             laboratory.








             The students were oriented with the

             location and use of the first-aid kits, fire


             extinguishers and other safety devices


             available in the laboratory.








             Precautionary measures are discussed


             before the proper laboratory sessions.








             The use of various laboratory tools and

             equipment were demonstrated by the


             laboratory technician and the faculty


             among the students.]]></page><page Index="29"><![CDATA[Maintenance of Laboratory






             The lights, fans and other equipment were


             strictly monitored/turned off right after the


             class to minimize the use of electricity with


             exception to some equipment placed


             within            laboratory                   premises                 which are


             under use.









             Every day, before and after classes, the


             utility personnel clean the laboratory

             rooms and maintain the arrangements of


             chairs and tables and other furniture in


             the laboratory.








             The number of chairs in the laboratory


             rooms was minimized to allow mobility

             while working.]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[Maintenance of Computer
